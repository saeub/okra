# Project goals

The motivation for this project is the need for collecting **objective data about reading comprehension and reading behavior**. This data is useful for natural language processing or linguistic research, but often require laboratory conditions and sometimes expensive equipment (e.g. for eye-tracking or EEG). This project aims to leverage smartphones to conduct experiments in a more natural environment and to make collecting data more efficient and enjoyable -- for participants and researchers.

These are the main goals guiding Okra's design:

- The app should be accessible, easy and fun to use for all relevant target groups.
- The tasks should be easily configurable and extensible.
- The collected data should be useful (focus on research and automatic text processing).
- The experiment environment should be as natural as possible (not "lab conditions").
